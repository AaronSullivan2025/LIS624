### Documentation Best Practices

*Good* documentation does more than list commands. It explains what you did, why you did it, and what changed. Write for your future self, who will not remember the details weeks from now.

Here are some habits that make your documentation reproducible and useful:

    1. Start each entry with the date and a clear goal or question.
    2. Create a new Markdown file for each topic or task so your notes stay focused and easy to find later.
    3. Add a short narrative: what you were trying to do and why it mattered.
    4. Capture the environment: VM name, OS version, tool versions, and project names.
    5. Record the steps with commands and important output lines or error messages.
    6. Note what changed: files edited, paths, configuration snippets, and decisions made.
    7. Include a verification step that proves the change worked.
    8. Avoid secrets: do not paste API keys, passwords, or private tokens.
