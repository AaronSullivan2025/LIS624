### 2026-02-06 - **Documenting with GitHub, Git, and Markdown**

**Goal**:  Practice with material presented in Module 2.4  
**Context**:  Meet the listed PASS requirments for the related assignment  
**Steps**:  As listed in our online presentation  
**Results**:  Successful on all fronts, including multiple whimsical changes and formattings, reformattings, and the more reformatting of this README file.  
**Verifications**:  Tested as per the steps listed in our documentation and no issues thus far. Yay me.  
**Notes**:  I chose to use nano as the text editor since more likely than not that's what most employers and organizations would fall back on as the default offering.
